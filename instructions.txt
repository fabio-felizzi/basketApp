MOO Frontend Coding Exercise

We've supplied a skeleton React application that's intended to implement a basic shopping
basket experience. A list of products is displayed on the page, along with a button to add
the product to the basket. The functionality to add the product to the basket has not yet been
implemented.

We'd like you to implement the functionality needed so that when the add button for a product is
clicked:

(1) The product is added to the customer's basket
(2) The contents of the basket is displayed on the page

We've supplied a fully functional REST API for you to develop against, described in the README.

Good luck, and if you have any questions, don't hestitate to reach out to us!
